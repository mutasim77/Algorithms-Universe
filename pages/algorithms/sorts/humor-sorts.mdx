# Humor Sorts 🎭🤡

Hey there, algorithm enthusiasts! I hope you're all doing great after exploring 
the world of sorting algorithms on this website. You've probably picked up some useful 
insights along the way. Now, let's take a fun and lighthearted detour as we dive into 
the world of sorting algorithms with a sense of humor. We've got a list of these quirky 
methods that range from being just plain silly to strangely interesting, but one thing's 
for sure—they're all pretty darn funny.😄 You might even find some of them oddly fascinating. 
So, without any more delay, let's jump right into this list of unusual ways to sort stuff. 
It's time to embrace the lighter side of coding! 🚀💻

**So, here's the list of algorithms that we'll describe one by one below:**

### Quantum Bogosort🌌

Quantum BogoSort a quantum sorting algorithm which can sort any list in `O(1)`, 
using the [many worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) 
of [quantum mechanics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)

Here's how it works:
1. Initially, the algorithm quantumly shuffles the given list in a way that 
conceals the order of elements until observation. This process effectively creates `O(n!)` parallel universes, 
though this division has no discernible impact on resources, given that it occurs continuously in [quantum mechanics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)
2. If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe. (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)
3. All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted...
